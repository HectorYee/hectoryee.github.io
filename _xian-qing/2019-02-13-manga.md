Japanese Manga
    Yotsubato: Perfect for beginners. You’ll learn tons about the culture and you can pick up loads of common words. The characters speak pretty normally too (apart from Yotsuba, who speaks like a kid… obviously).

    Berserk: This is for higher levels. There’s a ton of archaic Japanese and loads of uncommon kanji without furigana. It’s a great story though so if you can grab an English translation to read side-by-side, I still recommend it.

    Death Note: You could read this in conjunction to watching the anime and live-action versions and see which one you prefer.

    Nodame Cantabile: Great for music-lovers.

    Naruto: No explanation needed. It’s awesome.

    One Piece: I haven’t read this yet myself but my sister devoured every single issue in about a year and assures me it’s awesome.

    Ajin: Awesome thriller/horror-ish manga, which drags you in and doesn’t let go. Read my review of Ajin here.

    GTO: I watched the drama first and loved it so I bought the manga and it’s equally awesome.

    Bakuman: A manga about manga.

    Gyo: If you like weird horror, this manga is awesome/disturbing. Read my review here. 

    Rurouni Kenshin: If you like historical stuff, this is a lot of fun.

    Gintama: Read alongside watching the anime. It’s hilarious. Easily the funniest anime and manga I’ve experienced. Great for people who love Family Guy-type humour.


A few good first mangas:

Ore Monogatari – Adorable romance with fun, entertaining story and furigana! Has daily conversation and situations that you will probably come across in daily life.

Chi’s Sweet Home – A simple one for children with very basic Japanese and not much kanji. Great for beginners but also difficult because Chi is given a “cat accent” which turns words like かえる (to return home) to かえう.

Yotsuba-to! – Great for beginners (and my first manga I read all the way through) but does have moments with heavy vocabulary when adults are talking to each other.

Shirokuma Cafe – Has a steady stream of kanji (with furigana) but concrete sentences, not much slang, short stories and concepts explained in Japanese. Does have a lot of Japanese puns and play on words that makes it slightly complicated.
