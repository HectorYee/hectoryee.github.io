Just on Friday my parents fetch me from my college to Ipoh, back to my hometown. I spent two days over there visiting my grandma. Then on Sunday is the day for me to go back to university.

I depart at the old Ipoh train station directly to KL central by train. Had a nice trip which took around 3 hours. At last I finally reached the last stop, KL central. This is my first time at KL central. Looks busy but for a first-timer I do not know my way around and the directory did not help. After walking around for some time and asked a counter which sold long distance ticket then only I was told the ticket counter for KTM was a the lower ground. Bought a ticket.

I went off to Mid Valley since I wanted to get a headphone. First I went to Harvey Norman to search for a headphone at the range of around 100 ringgit. I found one outdoor headphone but it was out of stock so I went to other stores and I went into Sony Centre. There were a number of headphones available and one blue colour headphone attracted my attention. The price was 210 but there was promotion and I bought it at the price of 180.

Starting at 5 something then I went back to university. Reached lrt Univeristy Station then waited half an hour for 789, paid one ringgit and I deflighted at Enginerring Faculty to meet with Ernest. I passed some mooncake to him and we had dinner with him at KK2. Waited a long time for the dish and sat around with his friends. At 8 I rushed to UM central to catch the last bus.
