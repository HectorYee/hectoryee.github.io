Produced using [Atom](https://atom.io/), still trying out different editors. I like the UI so I've been using it for some time.

Published with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), managed and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/).

Fonts files are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):
- [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) by Cyreal
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic

I'm fairly new to using Jekyll and Ruby. The theme I'm using here is [Jackal](https://github.com/clenemt/jackal) by [Clenemt](http://clenemt.com/).
