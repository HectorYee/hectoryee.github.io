Produced using [Atom](https://atom.io/), still trying out different editors. I like the UI so I've been using it for some time.

[Update] I have since turn to [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) after trying them out. Atom is too buggy.

Published with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), managed and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/).

I'm fairly new to using Jekyll and Ruby. The theme I'm using here is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).
