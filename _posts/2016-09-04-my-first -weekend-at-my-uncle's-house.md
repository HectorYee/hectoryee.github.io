My uncle lives in KL and he is studying master in MU as well. So one day on his way back he invited me to stay at his house on the weekend. He called in the afternoon and asked me to pack my things ready. That day I was still deciding whether want to go to Feskum interview to join in the committee member. I decide to let go of it and stay at my uncle's house.

Reach my uncle's home at night had dinner with Aunt Carol at Ikea. First time eating there. Tried the meatball plate or don't know what. The food there is like pick and choose, though the choice is quite limited. Quite nice after I put some pepper on the meatball. Then I tried installing netbeans and tried some projects as this is the second weekend at MU. Most classes have just started the basic things.
