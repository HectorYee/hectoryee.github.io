Monday marks the end of my internship at the Centre of Applied Data Science (CADS). I have been offered the internship placement after winning a datathon back in March 2018. This is the wrap up of what I have learned from the work life experience.

The thing I like about the CADS is the flexible working culture. We can come at 8 and leave at 6, but the hardwowrking hours is 10 to 4. I normally reached office at ten and went back at 5.30, sometimes I stayed till 7 with Santa since the office is so comfy. 

CADS is currently located at Komune coworking space. The office was still at Komune 1.0 when I first arrived, but Komune moved to another tower and which is the now Komune 2.0. Moving is exciting! No mood for work. I once visited the old office at ADAX with the grassy floor. I heard the new office is under renovation but too bad it wasn't finished by the time I ended my internship. I will definitely go visit some other day. Some one joked that CADS is very good at relocating.

CADS provides snack for employees. I'm not quite sure why they always have the same Green Peas and Cheerios, too bad I don't like them. My favourite is always milk and the green tea bag. After lunch would be tea time and 4 is milk + cereal. They are the reasons I can stay till 7 in the office. My motivations.

Permanent staff has incentives. They have unlimited leaves, WFH (work from home), AIA bla bla bla. Unlimited leaves is great, but have to make sure people don't abuse it. I saw employees taking regular leave, I'm not sure whether they are using it right. There are also some who don't take leave. I like WFH. Sometimes productivity is higher at home, sometimes I don't feel like going to office. That's the perks of working in tech company.

Let's talk about the departments in the CADS.

### Data Science Department

I reported to Data Science team for the first two months. DS team has great working culture. They treat each other as equal, asking for help from others is a normal thing to do. I didn't feel that I'm at the bottom of the pyramid although I'm an intern. Philip, Janice, Sook Yan and Niki are good friends. Might be because we are young. Santa and I came a month later than them so they have guided us. I have fond memory here.

DS trains others. I think they themselves should grow more. They do have a skills matrix. But I don't it is implemented with enough significance. Some of the knowledge is too "textbook", where they know the topics but have never really tried using it in real. I would like to suggest so that they check on their skills matrix more often and work on various projects, get more real DS cases, get their hands dirty. I remembered having a conversation of them meeting some other industry people:"what is your position?" " data scientist." "what do you do?" "err.. provides training modules". I hope some day they would be proud to say that they are data scientist from the CADS, not only working on training modules. Have more projects under their belts that they can brag.


### Business Innovation Department

I was suddenly pulled to BI department without knowing anything. I was supposed to be back to DS team after two months but it was an empty promise. BI has a very different culture. Each person just do their own tasks. I don't see all of them working at office.



### Human Capital

I did not have a good impression of HC even before I came to company. My more-than-a-week application was finally processed after I called Nellie. Instructions were not clear on what to wear, bring etc. until I asked. Luckily they reply email fast and friendly.

Throughout my internship I only see HC people doing their work, nothing more. Before joining the company I had the impression that HR people will always smile and say hi to everyone, the happy mood bringer. Not here. A lot of stuff that should not happend, did happen. They did not treat employee as company asset. During introduction to newcomers, all interns are ignored. I was fine with it, since I'm just an intern I probably shouldn't say too much. Fortunately Linda changed it when I brought it up to her to recognise us too. But the bomb was when they refused to upgrade the other interns as permanent employee after their probation period had ended. The company almost lost them.

The CADS lacks proper onboarding for newcomers. We are just left to our own department. Newcomers don't get to know the company culture. Even after six months I wasn't really too sure either. I only know DS team and BI department culture.

HC here does not recognise talents. That's a sad truth. I actually came to CADS to pick up Data Science skills but I was moved to BI. I heard another sadder case, to do odd jobs their entire stay at CADS even though they clearly want to get to know Data Science. It is an irony CADS is training people outside the company but does not recognise talents inside. Leverage the right people at the right time.
